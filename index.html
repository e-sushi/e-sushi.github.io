    <p><em>Born in design, raised in code, dabbling in cybersecurity.</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Mike Edward Moras, but I am widely recognized as e-sushi. I am a seasoned professional with a diverse portfolio that spans cybersecurity, software development, cryptography, graphic design, and music production. My extensive experience allows me to tackle complex challenges and make impactful contributions across various fields.</p>

    <h2>Cybersecurity Expertise</h2>
    <p>I gained significant recognition in April 2019 when I identified a major privacy vulnerability on Facebook. My findings uncovered a flaw in how Facebook handled users' personal data, impacting an estimated <strong>1.5 million users</strong>. This vulnerability led to widespread media coverage and discussions about the platform's privacy practices, highlighting the risks of data misuse and spurring important conversations about user protection.</p>
