    <h1><a href="https://e-sushi.github.io/">Mike Edward Moras (e-sushi)</a></h1>
    <p><em>Born in design, raised in code, dabbling in cybersecurity.</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Mike Edward Moras, but I am widely recognized as e-sushi. I am a seasoned professional with a diverse portfolio that spans cybersecurity, software development, cryptography, graphic design, and music production. My extensive experience allows me to tackle complex challenges and make impactful contributions across various fields.</p>

    <h2>Cybersecurity Expertise</h2>
    <p>I gained significant recognition in April 2019 when I identified a major privacy vulnerability on Facebook. My findings uncovered a flaw in how Facebook handled users' personal data, impacting an estimated <strong>1.5 million users</strong>. This vulnerability led to widespread media coverage and discussions about the platform's privacy practices, highlighting the risks of data misuse and spurring important conversations about user protection.</p>
    <p>In addition to my public disclosures, I actively contribute to the cybersecurity community by sharing insights on best practices and potential threats. My experience has taught me the importance of proactive measures in protecting sensitive information. I advocate for stronger security protocols and encourage organizations to prioritize user privacy in their operations.</p>

    <h2>Proficiency in Cryptography</h2>
    <p>I have a strong understanding of cryptography, particularly in the field of cryptanalysis. My work in cryptanalysis involves evaluating the security of cryptographic algorithms and protocols, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and developing strategies to mitigate risks. This analytical approach is essential for improving cryptographic systems and ensuring their resilience against attacks.</p>
    <p>I also contribute to various cryptographic projects, collaborating with peers to develop secure systems and tools. My passion for cryptography extends beyond theory; I actively participate in discussions that shape the future of secure communication and data protection.</p>

    <h2>Software Development Contributions</h2>
    <p>As a software developer, I have created and released numerous programs that have garnered recognition in computer magazines and on software websites. One of my notable projects is MiniBin, a utility designed to enhance user experience on Windows, facilitating efficient file management. My contributions have been featured in various publications, highlighting their effectiveness and usability.</p>

    <h2>Graphic Design Skills</h2>
    <p>I possess graphic design expertise, having worked for major advertising agencies and well-known graphic design studios. This experience has allowed me to produce visual elements that enhance both my software projects and creative endeavors, ensuring they meet industry standards and client expectations.</p>

    <h2>Music Production Experience</h2>
    <p>Active in music production since 1997, I specialize in electronic and ambient music, showcasing my versatility as an artist.</p>

    <h2>Current Engagements</h2>
    <p>I've chosen to adopt a low-profile approach in my professional life, stepping away from platforms like Twitter and my personal website. Currently, I concentrate on various projects that enable me to contribute effectively while maintaining privacy.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>With a strong foundation in cybersecurity, a deep understanding of cryptography, and proven skills in software development and design, I strive to stand out as a well-rounded professional.</p>
